# 20% Time Literature Review

20% time is untracked, unmonitored, and totally for whatever you want to spend it on. If it's tracked, monitored, or structured... it's a spike. Fold it in as a "spike", in the normal sprint planning process.

## Notable Quotes:
> There is a big difference between pet projects being permitted and being encouraged.  At Google it is actively encouraged for engineers to do a 20% project.  This isn't a matter of doing something in your spare time, but more of actively making time for it.  Heck, I don't have a good 20% project yet and I need one.  If I don't come up with something I'm sure it could negatively impact my review. - Joe Beda

> Can 20% time work at other companies? I'm sure that there are going to be others that try.  However, I think that it is important to realize that it is a result of an environment and philosophy to development more than a cause.  I don't think that it is something that can be imposed in an independent way. - Joe Beda
