# Innovation

This repository is a rough consolidation of summary and analysis across an included article set. It's divided into two primary sections:

* **Wholesale Innovation**: These are the earth-shattering, principles-level links around innovation in general.
* **Incremental Innovation**: turning localized discoveries into global improvements across a company. Specifically, the investigation of a 20%-time-like mechanism and how to actually implement, measure, and maintain it in a company.

# Wholesale Innovation

Perhaps the best text available on wholesale transformation in IT companies is [Creating a Dedicated Transformation Team](dedicated-transformation-team.pdf).

There has been specific research conducted and insight gleaned in AI-related areas. What makes this research notable is that it actually generalizes across every single other domain. In one of the most lucid and important youtube videos available, Kenneth Stanley translates a mathematically provable rationale on [Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQPL9GooyI).

Finally, this one is a video I personally rewatch at least once a month. One of the original designers of the iPhone decided to leave his life behind and embark on an aimless pilgrimage around the world where he consumed and ideated on academic literature from a huge variety of areas. He's now one of the primary members of the "Human Advancement Research Committee" (HARC), and has produced some of the most (if not *the* most) beloved videos in the niche of people who like to invent, build, and produce new things. This is a dog whistle amongst a very specific community you're getting let in on. Bret Victor's [Inventing on Principle](http://worrydream.com/#!/InventingOnPrinciple).

# 20% Time Literature Review

20% time is untracked, unmonitored, and totally for whatever you want to spend it on. If it's tracked, monitored, or structured... it's a spike. Fold it in as a "spike", in the normal sprint planning process.

## Notable Quotes:
> There is a big difference between pet projects being permitted and being encouraged.  At Google it is actively encouraged for engineers to do a 20% project.  This isn't a matter of doing something in your spare time, but more of actively making time for it.  Heck, I don't have a good 20% project yet and I need one.  If I don't come up with something I'm sure it could negatively impact my review. - Joe Beda

> Can 20% time work at other companies? I'm sure that there are going to be others that try.  However, I think that it is important to realize that it is a result of an environment and philosophy to development more than a cause.  I don't think that it is something that can be imposed in an independent way. - Joe Beda
